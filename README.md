# ORFall2018
Repo for the Fall 2018 Osprey Robotics club. Please make a PR to add your name to the contributor list before making additional contributions.

If you would like to recommend learning materials towards our goal you can add them to the recommendedMaterials.txt file.

Rough specifications are being built out in the softwareRequirements.txt file, and the Flowchart .pdfs will be updated to reflect our current program flow.
-----------------
Current Goals:
1. Have all programmers set up github
2. Add all programmers as contributors to repo.
3. Have all programmers set up toolkit / environment (Python, Conda, Theano, Keras, OpenCV)
4. Clarify Software Requirements / Create Actionable System Specs
5. Divide programmers in to branches for different programming tasks
